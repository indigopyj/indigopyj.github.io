## Introduction of Image Classification

- **Image classification** is a core task in computer vision that classifies input image among given set of discrete labels.
- Challenges : Viewpioint variation, Background clutter, Illmination, Deformation, Occlusion, Intraclass variation, .....
- Many attempts have been made...

### Machine Learning : Data-Driven Approach

1. Collect a datasest of images and labels
2. Use Machine Learning to train a classifier
3. Evaluate the classifier on new images

## Nearest Neighbor : the simplest classifier
1. Memorize all data and labels
2. Predict the label of the most similar training image
  - For each test image, find **closest train image** and predict label of nearest image

### Distance Metric

#### L1 distance :  
 
\\[ d(I_1, I_2) = \sum _p \left | I_1^p - I_2^p \right | \\]

![img2](./posts/images/l1.png)

#### L2 distance:

\\[ d(I_1, I_2) = \sqrt{\sum _p ( I_1^p - I_2^p )^2 } \\]

- Difference : 
  - L1 depends on **choice of coordinates ** 
  - L1 is good when you know meaning of vector
  - L2 doesn't matter of coordinate frame
  - L2 is good for generic vector.

For example, consider the green line. Its $L_2$ distance is 1, same as $L_1$ distance.

If we rotate the coordinates to 45 degrees, its $L_2$ distance is still 1.

However, $L_1$ distance is $\sqrt{2}$ by its definition. As a result, $L_1$ distance can change by rotation.


### K-Nearest Neighbors
: take **Majority vote** from K closest points

- Limitation : Curse of dimensionality
   - K-NN is proper when data distribution is quite dense.
   - However, if dimension of data is increased we need more data to maintain the density

## Hyperparameter
= choices about the algorithm that we set rather than learn

### How to set hyperparameters
- Choose HP that work best on **(train) data**
  - only works well on training data when K=1 (if K>1, no works)
- Split data into **train and test**, choose HP that work best on **test data**
  - No guarantee that algorithm will perform well on unseen data
- Split data into **train, val and test**, choose HP on **val** and evaluate on test
  - Train algorithm with different HPs on training set 
  - Evaluate on validation set and pick HP of best performance
  - most common
- Cross-validation

## Cross validation

- Split data into **folds**, try each fold as validation and average the results
- Useful for small datasets, but not used too frequently in deep learning



-----------------------------
## Linear classifier

![img7](./posts/images/linear_classifier.png)

- **Weight W : ** template for each specific class
- **Bias b : ** data independence for some classes over another.(ex. if # cat >> # dog, then bias on cat is higher)
- **Dot product between W and input X : ** similarity between template for the class and pixels of input img.
- **Score : ** The larger scores, the larger probability of that input X being that class
